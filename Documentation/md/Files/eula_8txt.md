This End-User License Agreement (EULA) is a legal agreement between you (either as an individual or on behalf of an entity) and GitHub, Inc. regarding your use of GitHub® for Unity, and associated documentation (the "Software").

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, DO NOT INSTALL, USE OR COPY THE SOFTWARE.

            SUMMARY

 • If so, you may use the Software for free and for any lawful purpose.
 • This Software automatically communicates with GitHub servers 
    for two reasons: (1) to send error reports; and

    sample data to see what information is sent, and you may opt out of
    sending the anonymized usage data.
 • This Software is provided "as-is" with no warranties, and you agree
    that GitHub is not liable for anything you do with it.
 • You really ought to just go ahead and read the whole EULA.
    It's not all that long. You should not only rely on this summary.

            THE AGREEMENT

     Software.

 2. You may not sell, resell, rent, lease or exchange the Software for

            PRIVACY NOTICES

The Software automatically communicates with GitHub servers for two purposes: (1) sending error reports; and (2) sending anonymized usage data so we may improve the Software. If you would like to learn more about the specific information we send, please visit https://unity.github.com/samples.html. You may opt out of sending the anonymized usage data, but if you do not want the Software to send error reports, you must uninstall the Software.

 1. ERROR REPORTS. In order to help us improve the Software, when the
     Software encounters certain errors, it will automatically send some
     information to GitHub about the error (as described at the URL
     above).
     This feature may not be disabled. If you do not want to send error
     reports to GitHub, you must uninstall the Software.

 2. ANONYMIZED USAGE DATA. GitHub collects anonymized data about
     your usage of the Software to help us make it more awesome.
     Approximately once a day the Software sends such data
     (as described in more detail at the URL above) to GitHub's servers.
     If you do not want to send anonymized usage data to GitHub,
     you may opt out by changing your settings in the
     Settings dialog under the GitHub dialog.
